# Saúl Morato's Personal Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, hosted at [saulmrto.github.io](https://saulmrto.github.io).

## Overview
This website has been designed as a non-scrollable Single Page Application (SPA), optimized for a smooth and direct user experience. The goal is to clearly and professionally present my profile, projects, and contact information.
Additionally, a Linktree-style page is available to provide a centralized hub for important personal and professional links.

The main portfolio page (`index.html`) is structured into the following main sections:

*   **Home:** A brief introduction about myself, my interests in backend development, and my aspiration to become a Full Stack developer.
*   **Projects:** A showcase of some of the projects I have worked on, with direct links to their GitHub repositories for more details.
*   **Contact:** Information for you to get in touch with me, including my LinkedIn profile.

## Technical Features

*   **Responsive Design:** The page adapts to different screen sizes, including specific optimization for mobile devices.
*   **Intuitive Navigation:** Smooth transitions between sections without page reloads.
*   **Multilingual:** Functionality to switch the content language between Spanish and English.
*   **Technologies Used:** HTML5, CSS3 (with Flexbox for layout), and Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity.
