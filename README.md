# SaÃºl Morato - Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, accessible at [saulmrto.is-a.dev](http://saulmrto.is-a.dev).

The website is designed as a single-page application (SPA) to showcase my projects, skills, and provide ways to connect with me. It features internationalization (i18n) support, allowing content to be viewed in both Spanish and English.

## Features

*   **Home Section:** A brief introduction, outlining my passion for backend development and my goal to become a Full Stack developer.
*   **Projects Section:** Displays a collection of software projects, including:
    *   **POP3 Mail Downloader:** A Python tool for downloading emails from POP3 servers.
    *   **MailEML Viewer:** A Python application with a Tkinter GUI for viewing .EML email files.
    *   Each project card links directly to its GitHub repository.
*   **Contact Section:** Provides links to my LinkedIn profile and contact information.
*   **Language Switcher:** Allows users to toggle the website's content between English and Spanish.
*   **Links Page (`linktree.html`):** A supplementary page offering direct links to my portfolio, GitHub, and LinkedIn profiles.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the structure of the website.
